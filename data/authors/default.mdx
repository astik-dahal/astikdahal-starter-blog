Hi! I am Astik Dahal, a computer science student with interests in **machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence and human centered design**.
Currently, I am a machine learning intern at Lechia Recruitments, Poland. I have also worked as a software engineer and a product designer.
My work bridges technology, usability, accessibility and design to create an impactful system.
My approach is rooted in thoughtful reflection, aiming to balance technical precision with an emphasis on enhancing user experiences in practical, inclusive ways.
