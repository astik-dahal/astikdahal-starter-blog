## Overview

Morgenland Teppiche, a German e-commerce company, needed UX improvements. Our audit revealed four main issues: slow loading, complex checkout, poor search, and unclear inventory status.

Using usability testing, cohort analysis, and heatmaps, we implemented targeted solutions: skeleton loading for better speed perception, streamlined checkout, improved search filters, and clear availability indicators. These changes significantly improved user metrics and conversion rates through a user-focused approach.

## Identifying Initial Issues

My first task at Morgenland Teppiche was to audit the website for common UX issues. Several areas needing attention became immediately apparent, including color accessibility problems, inconsistent design language, and typography issues which was later fixed with a consistent design system. Addressing these fundamental flaws was crucial before tackling specific customer frustrations and usability errors.

## Research Phase

We dedicated four weeks to conducting an in-depth website audit to identify navigation issues, inconsistencies, user dissatisfaction, and technical errors.

### Primary Research

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges, I conducted extensive primary research, including:

- Engaging with stakeholders to understand their perspective on the website's current state, challenges, and areas for improvement.
- Connecting with users through surveys and analyzing feedback received via email.
- Conducting user behavior analysis, journey mapping, and heatmap testing using tools like Hotjar and Microsoft Clarity:

- Gathering user feedback from platforms such as Google Reviews, Trustpilot, and Trustami.

### Secondary Research

In addition to primary research, we conducted secondary research to gather insights on best practices and trends:

- Analyzing competitors in both German and international markets to understand current e-commerce trends and user flows:

## Approach: Fixed Goal Design Process

Our approach focused on solving one problem at a time, setting clear and achievable goals. Each fixed goal began by defining the problem and gathering insights through targeted research. We then created wireframes and tested potential solutions. The wireframes were iteratively refined until we were confident in the design.

We employed A/B testing and usability testing to ensure the effectiveness of our solutions. Each design underwent several iterations to address the problem comprehensively. Paired comparison testing with the internal team provided valuable insight into the impact of the new designs compared to the previous versions. Following internal feedback, A/B testing on the live website evaluated real-world performance, leading to the implementation of the best-performing version.

This feedback-driven approach ensured alignment between our solutions, user expectations, and business objectives. Rigorous internal testing paved the way for more satisfying outcomes for both users and the company.

Tools like Hotjar and Microsoft Clarity enabled us to analyze user journeys and identify pain points, while usability testing verified that our changes addressed user challenges. Through continuous engagement with these insights, we incrementally improved the design, creating a smoother and more enjoyable user experience.

## Research Insights and Solutions

Combining primary and secondary research allowed us to gain a thorough understanding of user pain points and best practices, guiding our hypotheses and informing our design decisions.

### Loading Speed

User feedback and analysis through tools like Hotjar and Google Analytics indicated that the website felt slow for many users. This is a common issue for e-commerce sites with large product catalogs, and it was causing significant frustration.

We researched how other e-commerce sites addressed loading times and explored performance optimization best practices. Based on our findings, we hypothesized that providing users with visual feedback during loading could make the experience feel faster. To implement this, we designed wireframes for a skeleton loading system that displayed placeholder content while data loaded, keeping users engaged.

It reminded me of the classic 'elevator problem,' where instead of spending on expensive mechanical upgrades, they simply added mirrors to keep people entertainedâ€”sometimes the simplest solutions make the biggest difference.

**Testing and Results:** We introduced the skeleton loading system, and feedback from internal stakeholders and A/B testing indicated that users felt the site was faster due to the immediate visual feedback. The feature is now live, significantly improving the user experience.

### Checkout Process

The checkout process, particularly on mobile, presented challenges for users. The checkout button was difficult to find, and the layout lacked optimization for different devices.

We reviewed how other e-commerce sites handled checkout experiences and evaluated best practices for mobile and desktop. We hypothesized that simplifying the checkout process and emphasizing key actions, such as the checkout button, would reduce user confusion. Wireframes were designed to highlight these critical elements, with particular attention to making the process more user-friendly on mobile. Throughout this process, we conducted extensive layout testing, removing unnecessary elements like the navbar and menu items to keep the focus on the checkout process. We also experimented with a multistep checkout approach, which unfortunately proved unfeasible due to technical limitations.

One of our inspirations came from a behavioral economics study about how grocery stores strategically place essential items to make checkout easier for hurried shoppers. We used a similar approach to prioritize the checkout button and other essential elements, so users could find what they needed without distraction

**Testing and Results:** We redesigned the checkout process and used the version 2 (v2) to make key elements more prominent and streamlined the flow for improved usability. A/B testing and usability testing determined that the final version provided a more seamless checkout experience, particularly on mobile, leading to improved conversion rates.

### Search Functionality

Users were frustrated with the search feature, especially on mobile devices, as it was challenging to locate products by size, color, or intended use.

We conducted competitor analysis and reviewed user expectations to better understand desired search functionality. Our hypothesis was that introducing easy-to-use filters would facilitate product searches. We designed wireframes incorporating swipe-friendly filters, enabling users to narrow down their searches by criteria such as size and color. We redesigned the search functionality to include accessible filters, simplifying the process of locating products. Internal feedback helped ensure we covered typical search patterns.

**Testing and Results:** A combination of A/B testing, usability testing, and cohort analysis was conducted to assess the impact across different user segments, and the redesigned search feature was well-received. Users found filtering more efficient and experienced reduced frustration, leading to improved satisfaction.

### Product Availability

Users often experienced frustration when product availability was unclear, leading them to abandon the site. We researched how other e-commerce platforms communicated product availability and analyzed behavior patterns to understand this issue.

We hypothesized that providing users with clear availability information would alleviate frustration. Wireframes were developed to include availability status alongside each size option, along with an option for users to receive notifications when out-of-stock items were restocked. We added an availability status next to each size option and enabled users to sign up for restock notifications.

**Testing and Results:** Close collaboration with the email team facilitated effective notification setup, while A/B tests and cohort analysis provided insight into user behavior post-notification. The new feature reduced frustration and increased user engagement, encouraging users to return when desired products became available.

## Conclusion

Our primary objective at Morgenland Teppiche was to prioritize user expectations and address them through comprehensive research, hypothesis testing, and iterative design enhancements. By focusing on skeleton loading, refining the checkout flow, improving search features, and clarifying product availability, we significantly boosted user satisfaction and engagement, as verified through Google Analytics.

This case study highlights the importance of understanding user needs, testing hypotheses, and making incremental improvements to achieve meaningful change. The key takeaway? Effective UX improvements require staying in tune with users, experimenting with solutions, and continually refining to ensure progress in the right direction.
